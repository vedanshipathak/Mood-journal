# üéµ Mood Journal with Soundtrack

A smart journaling app that detects your mood from journal entries and recommends Spotify songs that match your emotional state.

---

## üí° What the Project Does

-  Takes a **text journal entry** from the user.
-  Uses an **emotion detection model** (via Hugging Face Transformers) to analyze the mood behind the text.
-  Uses the **Spotify API** to fetch songs that match the detected mood.
-  Displays clickable links to **play songs directly on Spotify**.

## üîç How It Works ‚Äî Step by Step

1. **User writes** how they feel in a journal-style text box.
2. The app uses a **pretrained NLP model** (`bert-base-uncased-emotion`) from Hugging Face to detect the emotion.
3. The predicted emotion is then used as a **search keyword** in the Spotify API.
4. A list of **Spotify tracks matching the mood** is fetched.
5. The UI displays:
   -  Detected Mood
   -  Top matching songs (with artist name + Spotify link)
